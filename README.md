🌌 LuxNav AI - Space Navigation with DQN
A 3D space environment where AI agents navigate galaxies using a Deep Q-Network (DQN) and custom grid architecture.

⚡ Built in Colab. Pure code, no frontend.

🚀 Features
🛰️ Spacegrid: 3D galactic grid simulation

🧠 DQN Agent: AI that learns navigation

🪐 Galaxy Data: Simulated objects and positions

📊 2D Slices: View slices of space at different Z-levels

💡 Open Development: Progress shared with all mistakes

📂 Files
luxnav_ai_spacegrid.ipynb: Main notebook (grid logic, environment setup, pathfinding)

README.md: Project info, setup, and features

🛠️ Requirements
Install basic libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas
# For DQN: torch or tensorflow
Hope this is simpler and more to the point!
